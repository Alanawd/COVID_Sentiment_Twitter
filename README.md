## What is sentiment analysis?

Sentiment Analysis is the method of 'computationally' defining if a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It’s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion of a presenter.

### Why sentiment analysis?

* **Business**: In marketing field companies use it to develop their strategies, to understand customers’ feelings towards products or brand, how people respond to their campaigns or product launches and why consumers don’t buy some products.

* **Politics**: In political field, it is used to keep track of political view, to detect consistency and inconsistency between statements and actions at the government level. It can be used to predict election results as well! Currently BREXIT is the hottest topic. 

* **Public Actions**: Sentiment analysis also is used to monitor and analyse social phenomena, for the spotting of potentially dangerous situations and determining the general mood of the blogosphere.
