# 1. About Challenge?

## What is sentiment analysis?

Sentiment Analysis is the method of 'computationally' defining if a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It’s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion of a presenter.

### Why sentiment analysis?

* **Business**: In marketing field companies use it to develop their strategies, to understand customers’ feelings towards products or brand, how people respond to their campaigns or product launches and why consumers don’t buy some products.

* **Politics**: In political field, it is used to keep track of political view, to detect consistency and inconsistency between statements and actions at the government level. It can be used to predict election results as well! 

* **Public Actions**: Sentiment analysis also is used to monitor and analyse social phenomena, for the spotting of potentially dangerous situations and determining the general mood of the blogosphere. Currently COVID19 is the hottest topic. 


## What you will gain after completing the challenge week:

While working on this challenge, you will gain the following skills (and hopefully be curious to learn more).

* Finding information from the web about the machine learning and text analytics. Good source of information such as  Kaggle, Stackoveflow, Medium, etc. 
* What is text analysis and why it is useful? 
* What is NLP and why it is in so demand?
* Learn to use basic built-in features available in Python Packages, for example to processing text in natural language. 
* Thinking about what functionalities do APIs provide. 
* Using Google Colab for programming in Python. 
* Training a basic machine learning model. 
* Testing your machine learning model on the real-time tweets. 
* Thinking about additional features you would like to have (for example, making the sentiment analysis more interactive, maybe make the prediction more meaningful by presenting percentages or ratio) or creating a dashboard.
* Working as a team, allocating tasks to team members, monitoring progress, taking actions if things don’t work as expected
* Presenting your work to an audience

The hope is that some of these skills are quite general and may apply to any other task/project you undertake in the future. Of course, don’t worry if you get stuck- you can always speak to your team mentor or contact Dr Haider Raza (h.raza@essex.ac.uk) for suggestions.

## General information 

* For this challenge you will be working in groups of 6. You will need to come up with the design, discussing and working together as a team. Also, you will need to allocate tasks to team members (who will do what, when, how), monitor progress, take actions if something does not work as expected and so on. It is all about team management and working in a team. 

* In general, every team member is expected to put around 20 hours of work.

* And don’t forget to shoot videos, take pictures (both for your presentation and the 10 seconds a day video)

* I would suggest using [Google Colab](http://colab.research.google.com/). Colaboratory is a Google research project created to help disseminate machine learning education and research. It's a Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup to use and runs entirely in the cloud. You are only required to have a google account.
